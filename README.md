Our project will be a rust based stock analysis program with a CLI interface taking in stock information such as a ticker and using API's to fetch the correct data and predict the stock and give a basic analysis on if the stock should be bought or sold, all of which will use various ML methods.

Main Goals:
- CLI user interface for input/output
- Predict stocks based on past data
- Visualize stock data
- Basic suggestions on if stock should be bought/sold
